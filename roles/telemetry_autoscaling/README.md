* network called public
* network called private
* security group called basic with ssh and tcp enabled to the VMs
* a flavor called m1.small
* an image called cirros

Tests:
------
* Verify overcloud deployment for autoscaling
  * Test service API endpoints
  * Verify all the services are running on overcloud
  * Verify time-series database service is available
* Using the heat service for autoscaling
  * Create an archive policy
  * Configure heat template for automatically scaling instances
  * Create the deployment template for heat to control instance scaling
* Create stack deployment for autoscaling
  * Verify that the stack and resources are created
  * Verify that the alarms were created for the stack
  * Verify the deployment and metric resources exist for the stack
* Testing and troubleshooting autoscaling
  * Verify that alarms are triggered with traffic
  * Verify that Orchestration service has scaled the instances
